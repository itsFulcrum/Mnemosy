#  Mnemosy

Currently in development nothing fancy yet


the plan for this project is to become a texture library tool similar to Quixel but offline without any subscription.  Essentially a handy tool to manage and organize textures you already have on disk with cool preview and handy conversion and channel packing features. 

It is also  a learning project for me and my first bigger project using c++ and generally a way for me to learn and understand graphics programming and the graphics pipeline better
