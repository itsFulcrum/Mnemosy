Mnemosy is a tool to store and organize PBR texture files and materials.

The goal of Mnemosy is to be fast, flexible and independent of any other software or service.
This means that Mnemosy is designed to work with local files stored on your computer. No online accounts, services or subscriptions!
Textures are only stored on this local machine and nowhere else.
Mnemosy lets you export textures associated with a material in common image formats like .png or .tif
it even lets you drag and drop them directly from within the app to other software that implement drag and drop
