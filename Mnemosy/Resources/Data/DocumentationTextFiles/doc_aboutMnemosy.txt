Mnemosy is a tool to organize and preview PBR materials and texture files.

The goal of Mnemosy is to be independent of any other software or service.
No online accounts or subscriptions to access textures.
Mnemosy is therefore designed to work with files stored locally on your hard drive.

PBR-Textures of a material can be exported in most common file formats like .png or .tif,
Or you can directly drag them into other software that implement drag and drop functionality.
Additionally Mnemosy has build in channelpacking for pbr materials.
